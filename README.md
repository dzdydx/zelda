# Generate to Adapt: Text-driven Domain Adaption for Audio Tagging with Generative Model

GitHub repo for the ICML 24' paper.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for audio tagging using generative models and text-driven domain adaptation. Audio tagging, the task of assigning relevant labels to audio clips, is a challenging problem due to the lack of labeled data and the domain shift between training and testing data. Our method leverages the domain knowledge from pretrained CLAP and generative model to adapt the classifiers to the target domain.

More details coming soon.
